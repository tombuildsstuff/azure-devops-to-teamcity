##Â Azure DevOps to TeamCity

This project downloads a build log from Azure DevOps and then converts that into the format expected by TeamCity's test runner.

This allows test to run in Azure DevOps / Visual Studio Team Services / Visual Studio Online / Team Foundation Server and have the output displayed within TeamCity's Test View.
